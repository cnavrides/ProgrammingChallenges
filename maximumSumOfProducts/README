Given numbers 1, 2, 3, .., N,  arrange them in a order such that the sum of product of adjecent numbers is maximized.

For example: if N = 3, and we order them as ( 1, 2, 3 ), the sum of products is 1*2 + 2*3  = 8 and if we order them as ( 1, 3 ,2 ) the sum of products is 1*3 + 3*2 = 9.

Input format :

First line of the input contains T, the number of test-cases.
Then follow T lines, each containing an integer N.

Output format :

For each test case print the maximum sum of product of adjacent numbers.

Sample input :

2
2
4

Sample output :

2
23

Explanation :

In first test case given permutation is ( 1, 2 ). So maximum sum of product is 1*2. In Second test case the numbers are (1,2,3,4). Arrangement 1,3,4,2 has sum of product of adjacent numbers as 1*3+3*4+4*2 = 23. No other arrange has sum of product of adjacent numbers more than 23.

Constraints :

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 200000
