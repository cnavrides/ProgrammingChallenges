LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE
CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

You are given two sequences. Write a program to determine the longest common subsequence between the two strings (each string can have a maximum length of 50 characters). NOTE: This subsequence need not be contiguous. The input file may contain empty lines, these need to be ignored.

INPUT SAMPLE:

The first argument will be a path to a filename that contains two strings per line, semicolon delimited. You can assume that there is only one unique subsequence per test case. E.g.

XMJYAUZ;MZJAWXU
OUTPUT SAMPLE:

The longest common subsequence. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces on each line you print. E.g.

MJAU
Submit your solution in a file (some file name).(py2| c| cpp| java| rb| pl| php| tcl| clj| js| scala| cs| m| py3| hs| go| bash| lua) or use the online editor.
